# ACT Frontend

## Overview

## As part of our third-year group project, I developed the frontend for our AI-driven agentic trading application. This frontend serves as a critical component of our system, built using React and TypeScript.

## How to Run

### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Deployment

Before deploying, build the application and check for TypeScript errors using:

```bash
npm run build
```
